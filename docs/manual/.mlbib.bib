                 recommendation system for the Web, and has been

We propose a framework for modelling and solving search problems using logic,
and describe a project whose goal is to produce practically effective, general
purpose tools for representing and solving search problems based on this
framework.  The mathematical foundation lies in the areas of finite model
theory and descriptive complexity, which provide us with many classical
results, as well as powerful techniques, not available to many other approaches
with similar goals.  We describe the mathematical foundations; explain an
extension to classical logic with inductive definitions that we consider
central; give a summary of complexity and expressiveness properties; describe
an approach to implementing solvers based on grounding; present grounding
algorithms based on an extension of the relational algebra; describe an
implementation of our framework which includes use of inductive definitions,
sorts and order; and give experimental results comparing the performance of our
implementation with ASP solvers and another solver based on the same
framework."
